For Project 4.2, finish the distributed protocol.

1. Implement a simulation with at least 100 users.

2. Implement a web interface for the simulator you created project 4.1, using phoenix that allows access to the ongoing simulation using a web browser ( You might need to use the matching JavaScript library that allows Phoenix messages to be received in the browser). Create WebSockets using Phoenix channels. if you are creating a chart, you can use Charts.js

You need to show all the scenarios that you implemented in 4.1.

Bonus (+25%)

1. Implement direct messages to other users(5%) and do user authentication using method discussed in class.(18%). (5+18 = 23%)

2. Create groups and send group messages. (2%)

When you submit the project, make sure you include a README that explains what functionality is implemented, who to run the tests, etc. Also, record a demo of your application and attach it with submission.
