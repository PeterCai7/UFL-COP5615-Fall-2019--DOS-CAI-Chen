Important things to show:
1. group members: Ju Cai (UFID: 9669-1796), Tianyang Chen(UFID: 4925-2917).
2. The number of worker actors that we created:
3. Size of the work unit of each worker actor that you determined results in best performance for your implementation and an explanation on how you determined it. Size of the work unit refers to the number of sub-problems that a worker gets in a single request from the boss.
4. The result of running your program for: mix run proj1.exs 100000 200000.
5. Report the running time for the above problem (4). The ratio of CPU time to REAL TIME tells you how many cores were effectively used in the computation. If you are close to 1 you have almost no parallelism (points will be subtracted).
6. The largest problem you managed to solve (For example You can try finding out bigger vampire numbers than 200000).
7. (Optional)- You could also inspect your code with observer (using- :observer.start) and attach a screenshot of CPU utilization chart.
